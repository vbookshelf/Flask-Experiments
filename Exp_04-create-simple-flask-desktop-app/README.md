## Exp_04 - Create a simple flask desktop app using flaskwebgui

<br>

## Objective

Create a simple flask desktop app using flaskwebgui. This involves converting the Exp_03 web app into a desktop app. This experiment does not include using Pyinstaller to create a .exe file

## Issues

1- The window width and height (when the app is launcehed) can't be changed. This is a known issue. However, the window can still be resized manually.<br>
2- When I run app.py from inside Pycharm the app desktop window launches and everything works fine. However, when I run app.py from the mac command line the app desktop window does not open.<br>
3- I tried using Pyinstaller to create an executable on Mac. It failed. From this post it appears that the problem could be caused by Mac OSX Big Sur:
