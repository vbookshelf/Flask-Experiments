<br>

## Objectives

- Use flask, ajax and javascript to change the image that gets displayed. When a button is clicked the next image is dispalyed or the previous image is displayed.
- See if flask can return html code in the same way that php can echco html code. [Yes flask can do it.]
- Send javascript variables to a flask ajax endpoint.

## Notes
- This experiment demonstrated that flask can work in the same way as php when using ajax. Now it's possible for me to change php code to flask code.
