## Exp_17 - How to run a flask app from python

<br>

## Objectives

- Write the code to start a flask app from python, without having to type '$ flask run' on the command line.

Later Edit<br>
After doing this experiment I discovered that there's no need to add the host and port as parameters to app.run(). To run a flask app from python you just need to type the following in the command line (while being inside the same folder as app.py):<br>
$ python app.py

<br>

## Notes

- This is achieved by adding the host and port as parameters to app.run().
- Refer to the notes inside the app.py file.
- You will still need to type the flask url into the browser.
