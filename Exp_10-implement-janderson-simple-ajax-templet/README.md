## Exp_10 - Implement simple janderson ajax template

<br>

## Objectives

- Get the example working.
- See how the ajax request is sent.
- See how flask sends back the response, which is then displayed on the html page.

<br>

## Notes
- In this example the user enters some input into a form. Using ajax, the data is sent to the flask server. Flask then sends back the same data as a response. This data is then displayed on the html page by being inserted into a div.
