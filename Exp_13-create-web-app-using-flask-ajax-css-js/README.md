## Exp_13 - Create web app using flask, ajax, css and js

<br>

## Objectives

- Create a flask web app that inludes CSS and Javascript code.
- The orginal version of this app uses PHP on the backend. Here I've replaced PHP with flask.

<br>

## Notes

- The orginal version is deployed here: https://tb.practice-diagnosis.woza.work/
- This flask version uses only 6 images compared to 800 images in the original version.
- The python code incudes csv file loading and module importing.

## Lessons Learned
- Changing an app from PHP to flask is simple once you understand how flask works.
- One benefit of flask over PHP is that the flask app can easily run on the desktop. All you need to do is start flask from the command line and type the given web address into chrome. Then the app will be fully functional. This is helpful if you were building a tool for yourself. Having the app run run locally would save on web server rental costs, your data would be more secure and the app would run smooth and fast. Also, you would not be dependent on having a web connection. You coud use your app anywhere you could take your laptop.
