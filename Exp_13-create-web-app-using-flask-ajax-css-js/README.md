## Exp_13 - Create web app using flask, ajax, css and js

<br>

## Objectives

- Create a flask web app that inludes CSS and Javascript code.
- The orginal version of this app uses PHP on the backend. Here I've replaced PHP with flask.

<br>

## Notes

- The orginal version is deployed here: https://tb.practice-diagnosis.woza.work/
- This flask version uses only 6 images compared to 800 images in the original version.
- The python code incudes csv file loading and module importing.

## Lessons Learned
- Changing an app from PHP to flask is simple once you understand how flask works.
- The benefit of flask over PHP is that the flask app can easily run on the desktop. All you need to do is start flask from the command line.
